# prime_name
Every time I drink, I talk about prime numbers. It's a problem.
Blame Mark Haddon's Curious Incident, it only made it worse.
So, like any responsible adult, I built a website to drunk-talk about primes â€” now it's your problem too.

## Be a good vibe
Feel free to give good ideas, it'll be its own website next week.


I am adding a cesar cipher check as well, and Prime Name Combo notificatios for first and last name
